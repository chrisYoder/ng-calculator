## Layout
- CSS Grid
    - [ ] Can I generate the buttons using ngFor and then determine their layout with CSS Grid
    - [ ] should CSS grid go in component stylesheet or the global stylesheet?

- color scheme
    - [ ] I need a color scheme that gets away from dependence on the Ravenclaw color theme. Although, I do like the --ravenclaw-blue for the text. 
    - [ ] incorporate material into my design
